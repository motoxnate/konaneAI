Consider the advantages of making algorithms symmetrical across vertical and horizontal axes
    This would work really well if we could save board states
    Saving board states is illegal... so it may not be much help because each game will probably not evaluate
    symmetrically equal board states in the same game.
    This will be beneficial if we can save board states between games...

Design heuristic function for evaluating board states
    a. Subtract enemy pieces from friendly pieces
    b. Number of possible moves
    c. Use constants for weighting that could be self adjusting.
    d. Training methods for minimax constants.
